# TODO
- replace/modify drogon so that we can support WebDAV HTTP methods
- use drogon db wrapper
- demo mod
  - library

## Much later
- How to handle websockets/webrtc?
  - I guess mods have to start their own servers (bad)
- i18n: Boost.Locale ? GNU gettext
- Unfederated instance
- Interact with other mods on the same system?
  - ie - query contacts app for user suggestions
